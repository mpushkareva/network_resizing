# Network Resizing

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to reduce the number of parameters in a neural network while maintaining its accuracy. The code is based on the implementation of EfficientNet from a Kaggle competition by hmendonca, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hmendonca/efficientnet-cifar-10-ignite).

To learn how to use efficient-net with targeted dropout, you can follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook [EfficientNet CIFAR-10 Ignite](/efficientnet-cifar-10-ignite.ipynb). This notebook will guide you through the process of building and training an efficient-net network using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

To apply the resizing algorithm, you can use the notebook [EfficientNet_resizing](/efficientnet-resized.ipynb)..
